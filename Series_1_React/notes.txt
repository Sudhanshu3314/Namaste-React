// npm is a package manager which we will install sometimes our project dependent on packages and that npm will take manage of version of packages

// package.json is a configuration for npm

// In http there is a policy called as same origin policy in which frontend and backend must be deployed at same origin(domain) then only data can be shared very smoothly

// But , new concepts come into existence 
// i.e. (C0RS) => Crossorigin resource sharing which allow the two different domain (origin ) to share their data with each other which is not possible because http policy i.e. SOP ( same origin policy )

 /* 

 Parcel => Package
 1) Dev Build
 2) Local Server
 3) HMR => Hot Module Replacement ( Automatically refreshing the pages after saving the codes )
 4) File Watching Algorithm -> Written in C++ which always examine the code after a single change of code which make possible i.e. HMR
 5) Caching -> Faster Builds ( Program execution )
 6) Image Optimisation => This will reload fast loading of image in browser
 7) Parcel will bundle the files at one place (Minification) when we will create production base project
 8) Compressing the code => This will cut out the comments and white spaces from code for faster execution
 9) In short from all above this point , parcel such a beast which can transform the code in optimised code for faster execution of program in frontend on web browser
10) Consistent Hashing
11) Code splitting
12) Differential Bundling -> ( This allows to support web application execution in older version of browsers as well )
13) Diagnostics error
14) Error handling ( Good visual of errors)
15) https -> Give this feature also
16) Tree Shaking Algorithm -> Parcel is too much intelligent that it can remove the unused code for Optimisation of code and unused function from code
